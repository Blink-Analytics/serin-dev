Goal: I need help creating clear and actionable system prompts that can guide the development of high-performing LLM engines for [specific use case, e.g., customer support, educational tutoring, content creation, etc.]. The purpose of these prompts is to optimize both the quality of responses and the accuracy of the LLM's understanding, ensuring the model can handle a wide range of tasks effectively.

Key Tasks:

Define the problem space: Help identify the core objectives for the LLM engine (e.g., improving response accuracy, ensuring user engagement, or minimizing errors).

Clarify expected outputs: What specific types of outputs should the LLM generate? (e.g., summaries, recommendations, explanations, or step-by-step guides).

Incorporate constraints and guidelines: What are the limitations or rules that the engine needs to follow? (e.g., tone, length of responses, ethical considerations, or fact-checking).

Design context-aware prompts: Develop prompts that account for the context of the conversation, ensuring the LLM stays relevant to the topic and the user’s needs.

Handle edge cases: Provide suggestions for handling ambiguous or complex queries, especially where the LLM might struggle with incomplete information or unclear instructions.

Refinement and feedback loops: Create mechanisms for refining prompts and engine behavior based on real-time performance metrics and user feedback.
